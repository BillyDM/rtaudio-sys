# rtaudio-sys

Raw Rust bindings for [RtAudio](https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio)

This is used by the [rtaudio](https://crates.io/crates/rtaudio) crate, which provides a safe wrapper with a more Rust-y API.

This will build RtAudio from source. Don't forget to initialize git submodules (`git submodule update --init`) or clone with `--recursive`.
